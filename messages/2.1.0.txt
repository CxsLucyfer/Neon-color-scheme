Neon Color Scheme v2.1.0-FINAL
==============================

This is the FINAL release of the Neon Color Scheme in .tmTheme format, and does
not contain any of the improvements I've made over the past few years. You are
seeing this message because you are either still using Sublime Text 2, or have
not upgraded to the latest version (3.2.2) of Sublime Text 3. I STRONGLY urge
you to upgrade, not just so you can get the latest and greatest shiny colors
from Neon, but because of all the new features and bug fixes that you're
currently missing out on. To upgrade, just go to https://www.sublimetext.com.
