Neon Color Scheme
+++++++++++++++++

Thank you for installing my Neon Color Scheme! I hope you enjoy using it as much
as I enjoyed creating it. It looks best when used with a dark UI theme - I use
SodaReloaded Dark, but there are many other excellent ones available on Package
Control.

If you have any questions, concerns, bugs, improvement
suggestions, or anything else, feel free to open an issue on Github and I'll do my best to help you out.
